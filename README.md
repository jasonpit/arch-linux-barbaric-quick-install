# Arch Linux Automated Installation (2-Phase Setup)

This repository contains a fully automated 2-phase installer for Arch Linux. It is designed for quick provisioning of a minimal yet powerful Arch system, optimized for DSP and networked audio environments.

---

## üöÄ Overview

This installation is broken into two distinct phases:

- **Phase 1: `phase1.sh`**
  - Automatically detects root disk (`nvme0n1`, `vda`, or `sda`)
  - Wipes and formats disk
  - Optionally configures ZRAM or swapfile
  - Installs base Arch system with essential packages
  - Prompts for SSH key injection
  - Prepares and installs the `phase2.sh` script
  - Reboots into new system

- **Phase 2: `phase2.sh`**
  - Finalizes system configuration via `arch-chroot`
  - Sets timezone, locale, hostname (MAC-based)
  - Creates default user `archadmin` with sudo and realtime permissions
  - Installs network, audio, and development packages
  - Optionally enables ZRAM via `zram-generator`
  - Enables user linger + systemd audio services
  - Reboots into final system

---

## üîß Usage

### 1. Boot into Arch ISO

Start an Arch ISO via UTM, USB, or PXE boot.

Login as `root`.

Ensure you have network connectivity.

### 2. Run Phase 1 Script

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonpit/arch-linux-barbaric-quick-install/master/phase1.sh
chmod +x phase1.sh
./phase1.sh
```


* Phase 1 prompts for your **SSH public key** (optional), installs base packages, sets up auto-run for Phase 2, and reboots.

### 3. After Reboot: run Phase 2 if it did not automatically run.

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonpit/arch-linux-barbaric-quick-install/master/phase2.sh
chmod +x phase2.sh
./phase2.sh
```

* Final configurations apply automatically.
* You‚Äôll be prompted to paste your SSH key and then the system will reboot automatically.

You can also rerun it manually (e.g., from chroot):

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt /phase2.sh
```
